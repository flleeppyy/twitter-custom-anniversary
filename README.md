# Twitter Custom Anniversary Creator

This is a little tool that you can use to create custom anniversary links.


Notes:
- Going to the generated URL directly will not work. The link must be on Twitter itself (such as in a tweet) for Twitter's router to show the modal.
- If your image does not change/load, its most likely because you're using an image that's not from a Twitter domain.
- - Accepted image domains are *.twitter.com, *.twimg.com, *.x.com, and t.co
